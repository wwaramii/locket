ğŸ”° <b>Locket</b> ensures your passwords are always secure and accessible only by you. 
Hereâ€™s how we do it:

ğŸ”¹ <b>Encrypted data:</b> No raw passwords are stored.
ğŸ”¹ <b>Owner-only access:</b> Only the data owner can access their information.
ğŸ”¹ <b>Anonymized data:</b> It's impossible to determine which data belongs to which user.
ğŸ”¹ <b>Open source:</b> <b>Locket</b> is fully transparent and <a href="https://github.com/wwaramii/locket">open source</a>.

âœ… Your data is completely safe.

ğŸ”° Start using Locket by creating a new password pack with the /new command. Keep your secret phrase safe, and access or store all your secrets with /use.

ğŸ–¤ Enjoy Locket!
